 * @brief 
 * 
 * In this example we are covering how the timer can be reset using which we are simulating a keypad + backlight application.
 * 
 * Resetting a software timer means to re-start the timer, the timerâ€™s expiry time is recalculated to be relative to when the
 * timer was reset, rather than when the timer was originally started.
 * 
 * The timer that has a period of 3000 ms being started, then reset it at a interval of 100 ms in the keypad task,
 * before eventually expiring and executing its callback function.
