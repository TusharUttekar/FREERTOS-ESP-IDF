 * @brief 
 * 
 * This example demonstrates the use of a gatekeeper concept which can be used for preventing the issue's for the deadlock
 * and priority inversion when implementing the mutual exclusion of the common resources.
 * 
 * Gatekeeper tasks provide a clean method of implementing mutual exclusion without the risk of priority inversion or deadlock.
 * A gatekeeper task is a task that has sole ownership of a resource.
 *  
 * Only the gatekeeper task is allowed to access the resource directlyâ€”any other task needing to access the resource can
 * do so only indirectly by using the services of the gatekeeper. 
 * 
 * NOTE : Keep in mind that the vApplicationTickHook function here implemented is specfic to this example only.
 *        ESP32 has its own implementaion for the TickHook function which is used for its application.
 *               
 * Warning : In the below code the Tick Hook function of ESP32 is commented out due to which the core reset's by its own due to the
 *           dependency of other ESP32 related functions on the Tick Hook Function.
